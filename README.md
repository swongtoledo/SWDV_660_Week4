Week 4 Assignment


This has the server.py and the client.py requirements of Week 4 assignment. 

I have provided code that sends a "hi" or "any other words" requirement. 
Used the (b') function to get over the "a bytes-like object is required, not 'str"

The server requirements are:

   should accept connections on port 9500

   should use a protocol where the server returns "Hi" when a client sends "Hello"

   should return "Goodbye" if any other data is sent

 

The client requirements are:

   should connect to port 9500 

   should send the server a string "Hello"

   should receive a string back from the server
